## A simple text-based RPG

My project will consist of an application that runs a simple text-based RPG game. The game is relatively simple, and
can be played by anyone, even without prior knowledge of major RPG elements. The motivation behind this project is that 
I've always had an interest in web-based RPGs throughout my childhood, and this exercise would be a great opportunity
to experiment and learn the underlying workings behind such a game.

Users will be able to experience the world of *Aurora*, and begin their hero adventures in the small town of *Henesys*.
From there, heroes will be able to explore new areas, battle a variety of monsters, and collect powerful weapons
that will help you continue your journey.
